# TravellingSalesman
This is a trading game, inspired by this (https://github.com/Susseratal/Fantasy-trading-system). It's loosely based on the travelling salesman problem.
The basic premise of the game is that you will move between 5 different locations, buying and selling 5 different types of commodity.  Each location has a particular item it generally sells for less, and one it generally buys for more. (Representing different economy types) However, there is a number of days required to move between each location, during which time the prices will fluctuate. This is to accurately model the invisible hand of the free market with a random number generator. 
The objective of this game is to reach a number of coins in as few days as possible. 

Economy types and preferred item to buy/sell:

Factory: Metal/Cogs

Farm: Wood/Food

Forest: Machinery/Wood

City: Food/Machinery

Mines: Cogs/Metal
